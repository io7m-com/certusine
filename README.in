## certusine

The `certusine` package provides an ACME client.

## Features

* Uses [acme4j](https://github.com/shred/acme4j) internally for strong RFC
  compliance.
* Exclusively uses the `DNS-01` ACME challenge type for ease of integration
  with infrastructure without having to set up insecure web servers.
* A small, easily auditable codebase with a heavy use of modularity for correctness.
* Exposes a [service provider](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/ServiceLoader.html)
  API for integrating with new DNS APIs.
* Exposes a [service provider](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/ServiceLoader.html)
  API for implementing new types of certificate outputs.
* Supports [Vultr DNS](https://www.vultr.com/pt/docs/introduction-to-vultr-dns/).
* Supports [Gandi LiveDNS](https://api.gandi.net/docs/livedns/).
* Supports writing certificates to
  [looseleaf](https://www.io7m.com/software/looseleaf/) servers.
* Heavily instrumented with [OpenTelemetry](https://www.opentelemetry.io) for
  reliable service monitoring.
* An extensive automated test suite with high coverage.
* A small footprint; the client is designed to run in tiny 16-32mb JVM heap
  configurations.
* Platform independence. No platform-dependent code is included in any form,
  and installations can largely be carried between platforms without changes.
* [OSGi](https://www.osgi.org/)-ready.
* [JPMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Platform_Module_System)-ready.
* ISC license.
