      The <Term type="package">certusine</Term> package is extensively instrumented with
      <LinkExternal target="https://opentelemetry.io">OpenTelemetry</LinkExternal>
      in order to allow for the certificate renewal process to be continually monitored. The package publishes

      <Link target="a4a39f4f-44e5-48ae-9c6c-52d938d2b455">logs</Link>,
      and
      <Link target="d1c3a645-6cd2-46a0-9908-8cfbbfc69f7f">traces</Link>, all of which
      can be independently enabled or disabled. Most installations will only want to
      enable metrics or logs in production; traces are more useful when trying to diagnose performance
      problems, or for doing actual development on the <Term type="package">certusine</Term> package.

        The <Term type="package">certusine</Term> package is conservative in the amount of logging output
        it produces by default. The package is written to publish only a specific set of log messages to
        telemetry logs in order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. The
        <Term type="package">certusine</Term> package publishes strongly-typed events internally that
        are mapped directly to OpenTelemetry log messages, using attributes to hold the fields of the
        events, and using the <Term type="expression">certusine.type</Term> attribute to hold the name
        of the event type. The intention is to make it very easy to write alerting rules simply by counting
        occurrences of log messages that have a given type.
