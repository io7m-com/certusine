      The <Term type="package">certusine</Term> package is extensively instrumented with
      <LinkExternal target="https://opentelemetry.io">OpenTelemetry</LinkExternal>

      enable metrics or logs in production; traces are more useful when trying to diagnose performance
      problems, or for doing actual development on the <Term type="package">certusine</Term> package.

        <Paragraph>
          On a system that supports the querying of metrics using
          <LinkExternal target="https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/">PromQL</LinkExternal>,
          alerting rules should be used to notify administrators that certificate renewals are failing.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          Assuming that certificate renewal attempts are made at 30 minute intervals,
          the following rule can be used to capture failures:
        </Paragraph>
        <FormalItem title="Alert">
          <Verbatim><![CDATA[
rate(certusine_renewal_failures_total[30m]) > bool 0
]]></Verbatim>
        </FormalItem>
        <Paragraph>
          The rate of the <Term type="expression">certusine_renewal_failures_total</Term> metric should be
          zero over any given interval in a stable system.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph id="6549c521-5efb-49c7-8c20-53672a7a0106">
          Another useful metric to monitor for alerting is the
          <Term type="expression">certusine_certificate_time_remaining</Term> metric. ACME-issued certificates
          generally have relatively short expiration times. The de-facto standard 
          <LinkExternal target="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</LinkExternal> service issues
          certificates with a 90-day expiration. If the <Term type="package">certusine</Term> package
          is configured to renew any certificate with less than <Term type="expression">N</Term> seconds
          remaining before expiration (the conventional value being 72 hours, or 259200 seconds), and the
          expiration time of any certificate drops below, say, <Term type="expression">N / 2</Term>, then
          this clearly indicates that something is wrong and certificates are not being renewed as expected.
          An alerting rule for this scenario could be written such as:
        </Paragraph>
        <FormalItem title="Alert">
          <Verbatim><![CDATA[
certusine_certificate_time_remaining{} < 252000
]]></Verbatim>
        </FormalItem>
        <Paragraph>
          A value of <Term type="constant">252000</Term> (70 hours in seconds) is chosen arbitrarily. A working
          system should have renewed certificates minutes after the 72-hour renewal threshold. This rule could be
          improved by using the <Term type="expression">certusine_certificate_expiration_threshold</Term>
          metric:
        </Paragraph>
        <FormalItem title="Alert">
          <Verbatim><![CDATA[
max(certusine_certificate_time_remaining{}) < bool max(certusine_certificate_expiration_threshold{})
]]></Verbatim>
        </FormalItem>
        <Paragraph>
          The alerting rule would ideally be configured to fire if the above condition remains true for an hour or more.
          The rule is robust in the face of configuration changes; if the expiration threshold is changed, the
          value of the <Term type="expression">certusine_certificate_expiration_threshold</Term> metric will
          automatically update to reflect the change.

    <Subsection title="Overview">
      <Paragraph>
        The <Term type="package">certusine</Term> package is conservative in the amount of logging output
        it produces by default. The package is written to publish only a specific set of log messages to
        telemetry logs in order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. The
        <Term type="package">certusine</Term> package publishes strongly-typed events internally that
        are mapped directly to OpenTelemetry log messages, using attributes to hold the fields of the
        events, and using the <Term type="expression">certusine.type</Term> attribute to hold the name
        of the event type. The intention is to make it very easy to write alerting rules simply by counting
        occurrences of log messages that have a given type.
